Learning always comes from optimization
In our world to make thing work we need to have a complete understanding of the phenomenon
which can be accomploshed by 2 ways
1. Bound the phenomenon in terms of mathematics and derive its equations to govern its behaviour
2. Reach at a point to replicate the phenomenon through optimizations which is called learning as humans do because its       difficult to bound every phenomenon in maths eg. Our language, Our vision
